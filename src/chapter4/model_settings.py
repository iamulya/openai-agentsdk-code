# Expected Output:
#
# Sir Kaelanâ€™s steel-shod boots crunched on volcanic glass, each step an affront
# to the dead silence of the Obsidian Peaks. The air, thin and sharp with the
# stench of sulfur, tasted of ancient dread. Before him, a chasm yawned in the
# mountainside, a wound in the world that bled a faint, ominous heat. It was the
# maw of the beast, the threshold to Ignis, the Ember-Drake who had scorched
# the memory of summer from the lands below. Kaelan drew the Dragon's Bane,
# its silvered edge gleaming hungrily in the gloom, and took his first step
# into the dragon's shadow.
